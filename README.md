Data Visualization Mini-Project 1

The Mini-Project 1 is a brief exploration of some interesting facts about the births tendencies through periods of time, using the U.S. births data from 2000 until 2014. The facts are mainly:

-Births per week: births are supposed to occur randomly on any day, but is there a tendency between the days of the week?

-Births per month: in this is explored if there is a tendency of births through months.
